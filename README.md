# Oil Spill Detection Using Sentinel-2 & CNNs

This project presents a scalable, high-performance system for **automated oil spill detection** using **Sentinel-2 satellite imagery**, **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, and **Apache Spark** for distributed processing. It is designed to detect and monitor oil spills in maritime zones such as the Gulf of Mexico, Mumbai Coast, and Port of Los Angeles.

## Workflow Overview

1. **Satellite Image Acquisition**  
   Retrieve Sentinel-2 imagery for specified geographic coordinates.

2. **Image Preprocessing**  
   Normalize and convert images to grayscale, resize as needed.

3. **Oil Spill Detection**  
   - Apply binary thresholding and contour detection
   - Classify using CNN model
   - Combine results for improved accuracy

4. **Distributed Processing**  
   Use Apache Spark to parallelize image processing across multiple regions.

5. **Output Generation**  
   - Save binary detection masks
   - Annotated images with contours
   - Store outputs in region-wise folders

6. **Visualization and Analysis**  
   Visual dashboards can be integrated to monitor spill trends over time.
